#Play JSON Schema Validator example

This is small Play app making use of the [Play JSON Schema Validator](https://github.com/edgarmueller/play-json-schema-validator) library.

## Usage

After firing up SBT and starting the application, navigate to `localhost:9000`. There you can create, delete and edit 
Posts, which basically only have a single important property `title`. This `title` must be at least three characters long. 
This requirement is specified via the schema in the [Posts](https://github.com/edgarmueller/play-json-schema-example/blob/master/app/controllers/Posts.scala) controller.
If this requirement is violated, an (unformated) error message appears.
